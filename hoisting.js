/*
Two general phases when we run code:
- Creation Phase
    Any variable (let, var, const) and function in our code are stored to memory.
-Executing phase:
    Values are assigned to the variable and functions that were stored to memory during the create phase

The left of the assignment operator(=) is stored to memory, right side is assigned during execution\

// 1. 'num' has been hoisted - JS recognized our variable, it knows it exists 
// 2. Js reads top to bottom, when we called our console.log first, it doesn't get the value of 'num'
// console.log(num);
// let num = 12;
